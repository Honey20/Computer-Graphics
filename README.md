# Computer Graphics

A collection of C programs to demonstrate the implementation of basic concepts used in computer graphics. We use OpenGL (Open Graphics Library) in these programs which is a  cross-language, cross-platform application programming interface (API) for rendering 2D and 3D vector graphics.

## Setting up environment in Linux
    $ sudo apt-get upgrade && sudo apt-get update
    $ sudo apt-get install freeglut3
    $ sudo apt-get install freeglut3-dev

## Compiling a program
    > gcc filename.c -o filename -lGL -lglut -lGLU 
    > ./filename
